# CategoryProductAdministrator
 A simply Category-Product-Administrator Control System
 
-I wanted to design an application with simple user login and product and category editing in the database.
-In this system, after logging into the system as an administrator, you have access to all products and categories in the database. You can perform operations such as adding, updating and deleting these categories and products. All your transactions are instantly reflected in your database.
-Here are the steps you need to do for the system to work on your own computer:
-Download the relevant project on Git Hub.
-Then, after opening the project, edit the "connection-string" according to your PC.
-Do migrations over Entity Framework. 
-Complete the database setup by giving the "update-database" command. 
-After this stage, all you have to do is press the start button and enjoy the operations to be performed on the database. 
-Have fun.
